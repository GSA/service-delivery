# Service Delivery | Project Evaluation

Project problem statement:

What does success look like for the partner:

## Matrix

| Partner readiness | Ability to be successful | Opportunity for impact | Exit & sustainment |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Partner wants to work with us, there is a suitable delivery environment, project is shovel-ready, empowered project lead identified, partner is open to iterative development and human-centered design | We have the right resources internally and the capacity for this work | Aligns with our goals, has a visible impact, creates better user experience, able to deliver in iterative chunks, opportunity for continuing user value (aka not going to be scrapped soon), aligns to administration goals (i.e. CX EO, Equity EO) | We can define a clear scope, deliver, and move on; anything we produce must be sustainable by the program | 

Scoring: 1 = no, 2 = maybe, 3 = yes
