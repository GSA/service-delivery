# GSA Service Delivery

The General Services Administration's ([GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/)) Office of the Deputy Administrator established a new GSA Service Delivery team. This cross-functional team of technical experts' mission is to evolve and expand digital service delivery capabilities across GSA to improve end-user experiences.

The GSA Service Delivery team will pair with GSA programs to expand digital service capabilities and delivery of digital service to end-users. We will advocate for modern software development best practices – such as iterative development, product management, user-centered design, and acquisition strategies to support this work.
