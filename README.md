# GSA Service Delivery

The General Services Administration's ([GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/)) Service Delivery team is within the Office of the Chief Technology Officer. 

We partner with GSA programs to deliver digital services focused on user needs. 

## What we offer
The Service Delivery team can pair our technical expertise with your programmatic expertise. You understand your organization, project’s goals, and problems you’re hoping to address – and we can support you in achieving those goals. We see our work as a partnership, and we’ll work together to navigate complexities and solve problems. 
- **Discovery.** All of our projects start with discovery – so we can better understand user needs and pain points, program goals and objectives, and technical constraints. 
- **Digital service delivery.** We partner with teams to design, develop, and launch digital services. Depending on a project’s goals, our work might take the form of the following:
  - **Product management** to identify product vision, problem statement, goals, and roadmap to meet users’ needs; 
  - **User research** to understand the needs of users to inform the design, priority, and development of solutions; 
  - **Prototyping** to test what works, and what doesn’t, and build alignment;
  - **Content strategy** to plan, create, and deliver content that is clear, accessible, and serves the needs and goals of the users and organization;
  - **Product design** to create user interfaces, layouts, interactions, and information architecture based on research findings; 
  - **Agile development** to promote flexibility and collaboration, and iteratively deliver value to users;
  - **Usability testing** to get input from real users on how they interact with a digital product and use their feedback to iterate in design and development;
  - **Accessibility testing** through automated tools and manual testing we can ensure solutions are accessible to all; and
  - **DevSecOps** to build secure applications that are maintainable and easy to deploy – we can work with the GSA program and GSA security teams to get an authority to operate (ATO). 
- **Acquisition support.** We can partner with your team to de-risk procurement by structuring contracts for user-centered design and agile delivery.
- **Technical coaching.** Digital service development is never over – user needs change, technology changes, policy changes – and digital products need to evolve over time to meet these needs. We can work with your team to ensure they have the technical skills to manage a product long after your partnership with the Service Delivery team is over. To do this, we can provide coaching on modern software development best practices, such as product ownership, agile development, design, content strategy, and acquisition.

## About us

### Our mission
Deliver digital services focused on user needs. 

### Who we are
We’re a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, engineers, and acquisition professionals. 

We’re also parents, photographers, search-and-rescuers, immigrants, hikers, gardeners, and foodies. 

### What we do
We make digital experiences better for the people who use them. We help GSA teams deliver solutions that are simple, effective, and accessible. We listen, collaborate, and learn. We coach and model modern software development best practices – such as iterative development, product management, user-centered design, and acquisition strategies to de-risk our work and deliver the right solutions. 

### Our values
- **Start small.** We work iteratively and incrementally—proving out concepts and ideas and providing value quickly rather than all at once.
- **Show what’s possible.** We’re courageous. We take risks, try new things, and learn from our approaches to deliver solutions that are easy to use and maintain.
- **Meet people where they are.** Whether it’s our users or our GSA partners, we start by understanding their motivations, goals, and pain points and centering our work around their needs.
