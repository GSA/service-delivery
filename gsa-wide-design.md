# GSA-wide Design Hiring

### The [U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)](http://gsa.gov/) is hiring designers across the agency. We’re looking for user researchers and user experience, content, service, and product designers. Designers at GSA work on improving the way our customers and the public engage and interact with GSA products, services, and programs. We’ll be hiring for a variety of design roles at the mid and senior levels (GS-13 to GS-15*). Check back here in February for the designer job posting.

We are looking for candidates who are passionate about using design and technology to better serve the public. GSA is one of the [best places to work in the federal government](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2022/12/14/gsa-gets-high-marks-in-2022-federal-employee-viewpoint-survey). We have one of the [highest ratings in employee satisfaction](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/careers-at-gsa/why-work-at-gsa) among all government agencies.

Designers at GSA facilitate research to understand the needs of the people engaging with an organization. They work in an iterative manner ensuring that teams are consistently delivering user value and being responsive to user needs. They also collaborate on cross-functional teams with programs, engineers, product managers, and acquisition professionals to procure and deliver products, platforms, and services that are clear, easy to use, and accessible.
