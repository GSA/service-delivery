### **GSA SmartPay®** | Delivering on 21st Century IDEA

#### 🤔 Challenge

The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) administers the GSA SmartPay program, providing services to more than 560 federal agencies, organizations, and Native American tribal governments. 

The former websites experienced challenges: 
- The program website was difficult to navigate, and didn’t meet some of the requirements of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/) (21st Century IDEA). The website had accumulated content over the years, making it difficult for users to find what they needed.
- The training website experienced performance issues that disrupted user experience; and given users only needed to complete a training once every few years, many users forgot their login and password, requiring assistance from CCCM staff. 

#### 💡 Solution

We partnered with CCCM to conduct product framing, a content audit, technical discovery, and user research. 

In discovery, we learned of a tool built by NASA that could streamline compliance with [Section 889](https://www.acquisition.gov/Section-889-Policies) of the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr5515/BILLS-115hr5515enr.pdf) (NDAA), which prohibits the purchase of certain telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. NASA offered their codebase for GSA to build on – which was production ready and well built – and we were able to quickly modify and deploy the application.
 
We used agile, open source development, product management, and human-centered design to prioritize functionality and develop the new sites. The sites are hosted on [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) and [cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/). We also helped with an [agile acquisition](https://github.com/GSA/SmartPay-RFQ/blob/main/RFQ.md) to acquire a contractor for ongoing development support.

#### :earth_americas: Impact

- The [program website](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/) represents a 75% content reduction (eliminated 500+ pages of content) to ease user experience, and provide a more intuitive information architecture. 

- The [training website](https://training.smartpay.gsa.gov/) now leverages a loginless approach that alleviates burden for users, some of whom were only logging in once every 3 years, and the program, who were manually resetting dozens of passwords daily.

- Help desk inquiries have reduced approximately 90% – from 40 inquiries a day down to 3-5.

- The [889 representation](https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/#/) search reduces search time for 889 status by an estimated 95%, equivalent to 75,000 hours per year saved in burden reduction.

- All sites are 100% accessible, leverage the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), and are now compliant with 21st Century IDEA. 

- For the procurement, our team received an Acquisition Innovation in Action award from GSA’s Senior Procurement Executive.

### **GSA Fine Arts** | Making GSA’s art collection more accessible

#### 🤔 Challenge

The GSA Center of Fine Arts (CFA) administers one of the nation's oldest and largest public art collections, with over 26,000 pieces of historical and contemporary artworks. 

The former website was hard to find and navigate, which made it difficult for members of the public to discover and engage with the collection. The website was also difficult to maintain and understand what users were searching for on the site. 

#### 💡 Solution

We partnered with CFA to conduct user research and technical discovery and recommended CFA work with an existing contractor to build and maintain the site at a low cost. We designed the new site iteratively with feedback from public art professionals and New Deal art aficionados. The [new site](https://art.gsa.gov/) launched in June 2023. 

#### 🌎 Impact

The new website makes it easier for the public to navigate and engage with GSA’s art collection. It also gives the Fine Arts program the ability to easily maintain and update the site content. The site performance increased from 29 to 59, accessibility increased from 92 to 100, and we’ve seen engagement increase as well, with visits increasing by 248%.

> “_This collection represents the history of this country and belongs to every US citizen. It’s creative, celebratory, and shows the ingenuity and innovation of American people. [The website] should reflect this and capture that dynamic so people can discover this incredible resource and treasure._”
>
> – Executive Director of a non-profit arts organization

For this project, our team received a Customer Experience award from GSA’s Chief Information Officer.

### **OASIS+ subsite** | Providing a user-centered experience for a new GSA contract vehicle 

#### 🤔 Challenge

The current OASIS web pages on GSA.gov are difficult to navigate, lacking content structure and visual hierarchy; it’s challenging for users to locate information. The Professional Services and Human Capital Categories (PSHC) team found themselves supporting hundreds of help desk tickets asking for information that was publicly available through the web pages. For the upcoming OASIS+ contract, PSHC wanted to ensure their end users would be able to locate and understand OASIS+ contract information through a unified experience on GSA.gov.  

#### 💡 Solution
We conducted a user research study to evaluate the current state of the legacy OASIS web pages, identify content sources, and discover the problems and needs of OASIS+ users. We also performed technical discovery to explore the feasibility of subsites within the GSA.gov Drupal instance for increased flexibility in page design and more intuitive information architecture for users. Our design and content is research-based and aims to provide a modern, intuitive experience for the program’s web pages. 

#### 🌎 Impact
The OASIS+ web pages are intended to launch in Spring 2024. The new site will be easier for users to navigate and locate information without the need for support. Longer term, the site will be an opportunity to test a subsites design within GSA.gov with the goals of reducing the proliferation of new GSA websites, providing a tailored user experience, and easing website maintenance and associated costs.

## Looking ahead

The Service Delivery team is committed to making the experience of working with GSA as seamless as possible. We’re invigorated by OMB’s memo on [delivering a digital-first public experience](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/), and are happy to be serving as GSA’s Digital Experience lead. In 2024 we’ll be working with GSA’s Digital Council and teams across GSA to:

- **Deliver value to our users.** We will continue to improve the design, content, and accessibility of GSA websites.  
- **Structure contracts to support user needs.** Whether buying commercial off-the-shelf products or agile custom development services, we will partner with teams to help ensure new technology project acquisitions are optimized for meeting 21st Century IDEA and delivering experiences that meet user needs.
