## Project highlights

### **GSA SmartPay®** | Delivering on 21st Century IDEA

#### Challenge

The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM) administers the GSA SmartPay program, providing services to more than 560 federal agencies, organizations, and Native American tribal governments. 

The former websites experienced challenges: 
- The program website was difficult to navigate, and didn’t meet some of the requirements of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/) (21st Century IDEA). The website had accumulated content over the years, making it difficult for users to find what they needed.
- The training website experienced performance issues that disrupted user experience; and given users only needed to complete a training once every few years, many users forgot their login and password, requiring assistance from CCCM staff. 

#### Solution

We partnered with CCCM to conduct product framing, a content audit, technical discovery, and user research. 

In discovery, we learned of a tool built by NASA that could streamline compliance with [Section 889](https://www.acquisition.gov/Section-889-Policies) of the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr5515/BILLS-115hr5515enr.pdf) (NDAA), which prohibits the purchase of certain telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. NASA offered their codebase for GSA to build on – which was production ready and well built – and we were able to quickly modify and deploy the application.
 
We used agile, open source development, product management, and human-centered design to prioritize functionality and develop the new sites. The sites are hosted on [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) and [cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/). We also helped with an [agile acquisition](https://github.com/GSA/SmartPay-RFQ/blob/main/RFQ.md) to acquire a contractor for ongoing development support.

#### Impact

The [program website](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/) represents a 75% content reduction (eliminated 500+ pages of content) to ease user experience, and provide a more intuitive information architecture. 

The [training website](https://training.smartpay.gsa.gov/) now leverages a loginless approach that alleviates burden for users, some of whom were only logging in once every 3 years, and the program, who were manually resetting dozens of passwords daily.
