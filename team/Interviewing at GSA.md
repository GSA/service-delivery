# Interviews
The interview process with the General Services Administration (GSA) typically takes 3-4 weeks total, and we typically interview in 2 rounds. 

The first interview is a technical interview. During this discussion, we’ll ask about your past work experience and the skills and knowledge that you bring with you to GSA. 

The second interview is a core values interview. During this discussion, we’ll ask questions related to [GSA’s core values](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/mission-and-background) of service, accountability, and innovation. We will also ask questions related to stakeholder engagement and fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. 

We share copies of all of our interview guides with candidates in advance of your interviews. Sharing questions in advance helps our team provide you a better and more informed interview experience. As a candidate, you can better understand what we’re looking for. By sharing the same prep information with every candidate, you get a taste of our values in action and we ensure a fair, equitable hiring process. Everyone comes to the table better prepared. Federal hiring can be very different from industry or private-sector hiring, and we want to make this experience as transparent - and enjoyable - as possible!

# Interview Format
We typically use Google Meet for all of our interviews - if you are not comfortable or familiar with using Google Meet let your recruiter know and they will be happy to set up a test chat with you prior to your interviews! You can also test your sound and video prior to your interview using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10409699?hl=en).

In case there are technical issues with a video call, you will also be provided with a dial-in number, and you can call by phone.

We realize video calls aren’t an option for everyone, so we are also happy to work with a candidate’s individual needs to ensure they have a good interviewing experience and can use their preferred method of communication.

# Accommodations
We want to interview you at your best, and we’re more than happy to provide reasonable accommodations to support that! Let us know if there are accommodations that we can provide that will help you show your best self.
Some examples:
- Giving you extra time to answer questions
- Sharing questions in written form as well as verbally
- Bringing an emotional support or service animal to your interview
- Using a medium other than video calls
- Having a captioner or an ASL interpreter
